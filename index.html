<!-- <input type="submit"> and <button> are not exactly the same, although they can serve similar functions in a form. Let’s explore the differences between them.

    1. Basic Differences:
    <input type="submit">:
    
    This is an input element with a type of submit, and its primary purpose is to submit a form when clicked.
    It doesn’t contain any inner HTML content, meaning you can't add icons, text, or additional elements inside it.
    The text on the button is set using the value attribute, like this: <input type="submit" value="Submit">.
    <button>:
    
    This is a more versatile element that can be used to submit a form, perform actions through JavaScript, or even act as a regular clickable button.
    You can include any HTML content inside a <button>, such as text, icons, or images.
    You can also specify its type using the type attribute (submit, button, or reset).
    2. Attributes:
    <input type="submit">:
    
    Limited to submitting the form when clicked.
    The text displayed on the button is set using the value attribute: <input type="submit" value="Send">.
    <button>:
    
    Can be used for more than just submitting a form. It can also be used to trigger JavaScript or as a reset button.
    Can contain any HTML content: <button type="submit">Send <i class="icon"></i></button>.
    You can specify the button’s purpose using the type attribute:
    type="submit": Submits the form.
    type="button": A regular button with no default form behavior (used for custom actions).
    type="reset": Resets the form’s fields.
    3. Usage Flexibility:
    <input type="submit">:
    
    You cannot put extra content inside it (like icons or additional text).
    Its functionality is fixed: it submits the form when clicked.
    <button type="submit">:
    
    More flexible since you can add any HTML content, style it more freely, and use it for multiple purposes.
    If the type is set to submit, it works exactly the same as <input type="submit">.
    If the type is set to button, it acts as a custom button that doesn’t submit the form.
    4. Styling and Content:
    <input type="submit">:
    
    It's a self-contained, single element, so the only styling you can directly apply is to the input itself.
    You cannot place other elements (like images or icons) inside it.
    <button>:
    
    Since <button> can contain inner content (text, icons, etc.), you have much more control over its appearance and behavior.
    You can easily style it and embed other elements inside the button for more complex designs.
    5. Browser Defaults:
    Both elements behave similarly across most browsers in terms of submitting forms. However, certain default styles may differ slightly between <input type="submit"> and <button>, which can be overridden with custom CSS.
    Example Comparison:
    <input type="submit">:
    
    html
    Copy code
    <form>
        <input type="submit" value="Send">
    </form>
    <button type="submit">:
    
    html
    Copy code
    <form>
        <button type="submit">Send <i class="icon"></i></button>
    </form>
    Summary:
    <input type="submit"> is more limited: it can only submit a form and cannot contain inner HTML.
    <button type="submit"> is more flexible: it can submit a form or be used for other actions, and it can include inner HTML (like text, icons, etc.).
    In most cases, <button> is preferred for its flexibility, especially if you need to include more complex content or styles inside the button. However, <input type="submit"> is perfectly fine if you just need a simple form submission button without any extra content.
